**HW02: The Cloud**

We will be using AWS as cloud platform for some of your homeworks and
Labs. AWS gives all W251 students a promotional credit of
\$1000/semester. While this will be sufficient to complete your
homeworks and projects, leaving any unused resources like GPU enabled
EC2 instances, large datasets on S3 can consume the funds very quickly.
We strongly encourage you to de-provision unused resources promptly,
watch your spend/billing reports frequently, create Billing alerts to
avoid incurring extra costs.

**Any spend beyond the \$1000 limit will be student's responsibility!**

Create and Setup your AWS account

-   Navigate to https://aws.amazon.com

-   Click on Create an AWS account (top right)

-   Follow the prompts to create a new account using your Berkeley
    student email id (you have to use your personal credit card)

-   Once complete, Login to your account

-   Click on your account id (top right) and chose \"My Account\" -
    \"Credits\"

-   Insert the promotion code shared by your instructor and Redeem. You
    should see your available credits (\$1000) at the bottom of the page

Add an IAM user, group and a key pair

AWS Best practices deletes Access Key and Secret Key credentials for
Root user and recommends creating separate IAM users. These are needed
to enable CLI and API access.

-   Goto Services -- Select IAM

-   Click on Add User. Follow the prompts for user name etc.,

    -   Chose to add Groups (select AdminFull Access role) and fill out
        other details incl. adding new user to the new group you just
        created

    -   Select to have User Access and Secret Key created and download
        the details to xls

    -   On your Laptop(Mac or windows), download, install and configure
        AWS CLI-v2 using the new User credentials you just created.
        Follow the instructions from the link below.

        <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/install-cliv2.html>

-   Go to Services-EC2-Keypairs

-   Create new keypair and download the .pem file

-   Chmod 400 .pem file

-   On your workstation

    -   ssh-add -K "your\_keypair.pem" (This adds the new keypair to you
        local ssh identities)

    -   ssh-add -L )To see the list of identities)

Launch and Test Key AWS Resources

-   Create Default VPC

aws ec2 create-default-vpc

aws ec2 describe-vpcs (find the vpc-id of the one you just created)

-   Create Public and Private security groups

\#aws ec2 create-security-group \--group-name PublicSG \--description
\"Bastion Host Security group\" \--vpc-id vpc-XXXXXXXX(vpc-d from above
command)

\#aws ec2 describe-security-groups (extract PublicSG id)

\#aws ec2 create-security-group \--group-name PrivateSG \--description
\"Bastion Host Security group\" \--vpc-id vpc-XXXXXXXX(vpc-d from above
command)

\#aws ec2 describe-security-groups (extract PrivateSG id)

-   Add SSH Ingress rule to Security groups

\#aws ec2 authorize-security-group-ingress \--group-id sg-xxxxxxxxxx
\--protocol tcp \--port 22 \--cidr 0.0.0.0/0

\#aws ec2 authorize-security-group-ingress \--group-id sg-xxxxxxxxxx
\--protocol tcp \--port 22 \--cidr 0.0.0.0/0

(You can update only with Bastio Host CIDR if needed)

-   Launch Bastion EC2 Instance(JumpBox) into the public Security Group
    using Ubuntu AMI on t2.micro instance(free tier) in the default VPC

\#aws ec2 run-instances \--image-id ami-0bcc094591f354be2
\--instance-type t2.micro \--security-group-ids sg-xxxxxxxxx
\--associate-public-ip-address \--key-name "your\_keypair.pem"

\#aws ec2 describe-instances

(grep for the instance name, similar to:
ec2-54-236-50-196.compute-1.amazonaws.com)

-   Launch Private EC2 instance into Private Security Group using Ubuntu
    AMI on a t2.micro instance (free tier) in the default VPC

\#aws ec2 run-instances \--image-id ami-0bcc094591f354be2
\--instance-type t2.micro \--security-group-ids sg-xxxxxxxxxx
\--key-name "your\_keypair.pem"

\#aws ec2 describe-instances

(grep for the instance name, similar to:
ec2-54-236-50-196.compute-1.amazonaws.com

-   SSH into Baston Host first and then to Private instance from Bastion
    Host.

\#ssh -A <ubuntu@ec2-54-236-50-196.compute-1.amazonaws.com> (from your
work station)

\#ssh -A <ubuntu@ec2-54-236-50-196.compute-1.amazonaws.com> (from
Bastion host)

-   Delete Private instance but keep rest of the resources incl. Bastion
    Host for other home works
