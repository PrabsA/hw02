Create Bastion Host (JumpBox)

Bastion host will function as a jumpbox

Create Default VPC

aws ec2 create-default-vpc

aws ec2 describe-vpcs (find the vpc-id of the one you just created)

Create 1. Public and 2. Private security groups

\#aws ec2 create-security-group \--group-name PublicSG \--description
\"Bastion Host Security group\" \--vpc-id vpc-XXXXXXXX(vpc-d from above
command)

\#aws ec2 describe-security-groups (extract PublicSG id)

\#aws ec2 create-security-group \--group-name PrivateSG \--description
\"Bastion Host Security group\" \--vpc-id vpc-XXXXXXXX(vpc-d from above
command)

\#aws ec2 describe-security-groups (extract PrivateSG id)

Add SSH Ingress rules to Security groups

\#aws ec2 authorize-security-group-ingress \--group-id sg-xxxxxxxxxx
\--protocol tcp \--port 22 \--cidr 0.0.0.0/0

\#aws ec2 authorize-security-group-ingress \--group-id sg-xxxxxxxxxx
\--protocol tcp \--port 22 \--cidr 0.0.0.0/0

(You can update only with Bastio Host CIDR if needed)

Launch Bastion Ec2 Instance into the public Security Group using Ubuntu
AMI on t2.micro instance(free tier) into the Security group and default
VPC

\#aws ec2 run-instances \--image-id ami-0bcc094591f354be2
\--instance-type t2.micro \--security-group-ids sg-xxxxxxxxx
\--associate-public-ip-address \--key-name "your\_keypair.pem"

\#aws ec2 describe-instances

(grep for the instance name, similar to:
ec2-54-236-50-196.compute-1.amazonaws.com)

SSH into Bastion Host

\#ssh -A ubuntu\@ec2-54-236-50-196.compute-1.amazonaws.com

Launch Private EC2 instance

\#aws ec2 run-instances \--image-id ami-0bcc094591f354be2
\--instance-type t2.micro \--security-group-ids sg-xxxxxxxxxx
\--key-name "your\_keypair.pem"

\#aws ec2 describe-instances

(grep for the instance name, similar to:
ec2-54-236-50-196.compute-1.amazonaws.com

SSH into Private instance from Bastion Host.

\#ssh -A ubuntu\@ec2-54-236-50-196.compute-1.amazonaws.com
